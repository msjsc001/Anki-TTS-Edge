# Anki-TTS-Edge

**[中文文档](https://github.com/msjsc001/Anki-TTS-Edge/blob/master/README.md)**

<div align="center">

Anki-TTS-Edge is a free, high-quality voice generation tool powered by Microsoft Edge TTS. It **quickly generates audio from selected text**, supports dual-voice mode for generating audio with two different voices, and automatically copies the generated audio to clipboard for fast pasting into apps like Anki. It also serves as a **convenient reading tool for language learning and article reading**.
**Completely rebuilt with Flet (Flutter) in v2.0**, featuring a modern UI, smooth animations, and enhanced functionality.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Modern UI**: Built with Flet (Flutter) for a sleek, responsive experience with dark/light theme support.
- **300+ Free Voices**: Access the full Microsoft Edge Neural TTS voice library across dozens of languages and regional accents.
- **Real-time Word Highlighting**: Words are highlighted in sync during playback, handling complex mappings (e.g. "1" -> "one") perfectly.
- **Click-to-Play**: Click any word or character during playback to instantly start from that exact position.
- **Smart Navigation**: "Previous/Next Sentence" controls for easy sentence-by-sentence review.
- **Dual Voice Mode**: "Dual Blue Dot" system for quick switching between two voice configurations (e.g., Male/Female, US/UK accents).
- **History Management**: Automatically saves generation history. Re-listen, copy, or delete records; deep cleanup reclaims orphaned files.
- **Smart Monitoring**:
  - **Clipboard Monitor**: Automatically captures copied text for instant generation.
  - **Selection Monitor**: (Windows) Generate audio instantly by selecting text.
- **System Integration**:
  - **Tray Support**: Minimize to system tray to keep your workspace clean.
  - **Pin to Top**: Keep the window always on top for studying.
  - **Internationalization**: Full English and Chinese UI with live switching.
  - **Centralized Data**: All user data stored in `%APPDATA%/Anki-TTS-Edge/` for clean organization.

## 🚀 Installation & Running

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Windows (Recommended for full feature support like Selection Monitor)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msjsc001/Anki-TTS-Edge.git
   cd Anki-TTS-Edge
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r Anki-TTS-Flet/requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install:*
   ```bash
   pip install flet edge-tts pygame pyperclip pynput pystray pillow pywin32
   ```

3. **Run Application**
   ```bash
   python Anki-TTS-Flet/main.py
   ```

## 👨‍💻 Developer Guide

Welcome developers to contribute and customize Anki-TTS-Edge! Below are the core architecture details and guidelines for the project.

### Technology Stack
* **UI Framework**: Flet (Python UI framework based on Flutter), providing responsive design and fluid animations.
* **Core TTS Engine**: `edge-tts` (Unofficial implementation of Microsoft Edge neural voice API).
* **Audio & Media**: `pygame` (Provides stable, low-latency multi-threaded audio playback capabilities).
* **System Integration**: `pyperclip` (Clipboard monitoring), `pystray` / `pillow` (System tray integration).
* **Asynchronous Concurrency**: Heavy usage of Python's `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O operations, ensuring the UI thread remains smooth during network requests or playback.

### Core Technical Highlights
1. **Subtitle-Level Alignment (Text-to-Speech Alignment)**
   Leverages `edge-tts` word boundaries and timestamps to dynamically update Flet's `TextSpan` and `TextStyle` within the audio playback callback, achieving "Karaoke-style" exact word synchronization.
2. **Global Input & Clipboard Monitor**
   A dedicated background thread continuously polls the system clipboard (or detects selected text). Upon detecting a change, it immediately brings the application window to the forefront (Bring to Front), eliminating cumbersome manual copy-paste steps during flashcard creation.
3. **Audio State & Garbage Collection**
   Implemented an aggressive cleanup mechanism in the history management module. It uses hashing and path tracking for audio and metadata (`.json`), and automatically iterates through local file lists during deletion to confidently discard "orphaned" files.
4. **Componentization & State Management**
   The UI is divided into independent routed views (Home, History, Settings) that communicate with low coupling via a global state manager or dependency injection.

### 🔨 Building an Executable (EXE)

To bundle the application into a standalone Windows executable, we use PyInstaller in **folder (onedir) mode**:

> ⚠️ **Important**: Do NOT use `--onefile` mode. Single-file mode causes extremely slow startup on Windows (the entire application must be extracted to a temp directory on every launch, and frequently triggers antivirus scans).

```bash
# Ensure PyInstaller is installed in your virtual environment
pip install pyinstaller

# Run the build command from the project root (folder mode)
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m PyInstaller Anki-TTS-Flet/main.py --name "Anki-TTS-Edge" --icon "Anki-TTS-Flet/assets/icon.ico" --add-data "Anki-TTS-Flet/assets;assets" --collect-all edge_tts --hidden-import=pystray --hidden-import=PIL --hidden-import=pygame --hidden-import=pynput --hidden-import=win32clipboard --hidden-import=win32con --noconsole --clean --noconfirm
```

Upon successful build, the `dist/Anki-TTS-Edge/` directory contains the complete distributable application, with `Anki-TTS-Edge.exe` as the entry point.

## 🛠️ Usage Guide

1. **Select Voice**: Use the dropdown menus to filter by Language and Region.
2. **Generate**: Type or paste text, then click the **Blue Dot** to generate audio.
   - **Left Dot**: Uses "Language (Left)" settings.
   - **Right Dot**: Uses "Language (Right)" settings.
3. **Copy File**: After generation (Green -> Red dot), click the Red dot or use **Ctrl+C** to copy the audio file path (for pasting into Anki).
4. **History**: Switch to the **History** tab to view and manage past generations.
5. **Settings**: Customize theme (Dark/Light), behavior (Autoplay, Tray), and more in the **Settings** tab.
