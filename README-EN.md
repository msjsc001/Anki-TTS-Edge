> Main application interface for selecting voices, entering text, generating audio, and playback.

## Key Features

- **Online and offline engines**: Use Microsoft Edge online voices by default or install Local Kokoro for offline synthesis.
- **Dual voice slots**: Voice Lists 1 and 2 map consistently to `A / B`, useful for pronunciation comparison and dual-voice cards.
- **Selection and copy triggers**: Generate speech quickly from copied text or Windows text selection.
- **Synchronized reading and point-read**: Online voices support timestamp highlighting, sentence navigation, and precise seeking; offline point-read works through re-synthesis.
- **Audio file clipboard support**: Paste a generated MP3 directly into Anki and other applications.
- **History and cleanup**: Replay, delete, or clear history while reclaiming orphaned application audio.
- **Desktop integration**: Includes system tray, always-on-top, autoplay, light/dark themes, and customizable interface scaling.
- **Chinese and English UI**: Switch the interface language at any time; settings persist automatically.

## Download and Run

### Option 1: Download the Windows package (recommended)

1. Open the [latest Release](https://github.com/EllisMorrow/Anki-TTS-Edge/releases/latest).
2. Download `Anki-TTS-Edge-v2.9.5-windows-amd64.zip`.
3. Extract the complete ZIP, then run `Anki-TTS-Edge.exe`.

> Keep the extracted folder together. Do not move only the EXE.

### Option 2: Run from source

Requirements: Windows and Python 3.10 or newer.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/EllisMorrow/Anki-TTS-Edge.git
cd Anki-TTS-Edge
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r Anki-TTS-Flet\requirements.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe Anki-TTS-Flet\main.py
```

## How to Use

1. **Choose an engine**: Edge TTS is the default. Switch to Local Kokoro in Settings when offline synthesis is needed.
2. **Choose voices**: Single-voice mode uses Voice List 2. In dual mode, `A` uses Voice List 1 and `B` uses Voice List 2.
3. **Generate audio**: Enter or paste text, then use a generation button. Autoplay and MP3 clipboard behavior are configurable.
4. **Generate from copy or selection**: Enable the relevant monitor, copy text or select it in Windows, then choose `GO / A / B` from the floating control.
5. **Playback and point-read**: Online mode supports synchronized highlighting, sentence navigation, and text seeking. Offline mode re-synthesizes from the selected position.
6. **Manage history**: Replay or delete entries on the History page. Clear All also removes associated audio.
7. **Install the offline engine**: Select Offline under `Settings → TTS Engine`, click Download & Install, then run Re-validate when installation finishes.
8. **Resize the interface**: Enter a custom scale between `30%` and `200%` under `Settings → Appearance → Interface Scale`, then restart the app. Window dimensions remain independently configurable.

User settings, history, audio, and the optional offline engine are stored under:

```text
%APPDATA%/Anki-TTS-Edge/
```

## What's New in v2.9.5

- Interface scaling now accepts a custom value between `30%` and `200%` for text, icons, spacing, and key fixed regions.
- Short windows now use a scrollable compact layout; the saved scale takes effect on the next launch.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

```

### Build the Windows Application

The project uses PyInstaller in `onedir` mode. Do not switch to `onefile`; it increases startup delay and antivirus scanning risk.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pyinstaller
.\.venv\Scripts\pyinstaller.exe -y --clean Anki-TTS-Edge.spec
```

The output is written to `dist/Anki-TTS-Edge/`, with `Anki-TTS-Edge.exe` as the entry point. Distributions must keep the complete directory and the adjacent `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` files.

### Validation

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -p "test_*.py"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\flet_runtime_selfcheck.py
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q Anki-TTS-Flet scripts tools
```
